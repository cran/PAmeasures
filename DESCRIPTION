Description: We propose a pair of summary measures for the predictive power of a prediction
    function based on a regression model. The regression model can be linear
    or nonlinear, parametric, semi-parametric, or nonparametric, and correctly
    specified or mis-specified. The first measure, R-squared, is an extension of
    the classical R-squared statistic for a linear model, quantifying the prediction
    function's ability to capture the variability of the response. The second
    measure, L-squared, quantifies the prediction function's bias for predicting the
    mean regression function. When used together, they give a complete summary of
    the predictive power of a prediction function. Please refer to Gang Li and Xiaoyan Wang (2016) <arXiv:1611.03063> for more details.
